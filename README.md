# Image Classification using CNN

## About the Dataset
The dataset used for this project was the MNIST Fashion dataset which was imported using Tensorflow and Keras. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The dataset contains 10 labels.

## About the Project
The objective of the project is to classify the given images into one of the categoies of T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot.
The model is built using the Keras API. Sequential model from Keras is used and Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers are used. Flatten layers are used flatten 2D arrays to 1D arrays before building the fully connected layers. The model is trained and tested with an accuracy of 89%.
